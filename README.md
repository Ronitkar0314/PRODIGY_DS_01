# PRODIGY_DS_01
This project analyzes the World Bank Population Dataset (1960â€“2020) to uncover insights about global population growth, country-wise trends, and region-wise patterns.  Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), the notebook demonstrates data cleaning, merging, and visualization techniques to convert raw data into meaningful insights.
